# perf
## A CLI to test JavaScript instructions performances
### Work in progress.

The idea behind this small tool is to easily have an idea of how fast an instruction is compared to another.

The most basic use would simply be to run the `perf`command with our two instructions to test and see which runs faster.

But better features shall be implemented, offering a dorect comparison of different instructions, testing the speed of a whole .js file, customizing the testing environment, etc...
